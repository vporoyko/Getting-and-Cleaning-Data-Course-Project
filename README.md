The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
#Here I submit: 
#1. R script 
run_analysis.R that does the following.
Downloads data from the web repository
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#2. CodeBook.md 
Code book that describes the variables, the data, and work that you performed to clean up the data.
